;Write an ALP that will examine a set of strings. 
;The length each string is four characters. The 
;number of strings to be examined is stored in location 'cnt1’. 
;The strings are stored starting 
;from location 'dat1’. The ALP should scan each string 
;and see if it is equal to ' ' (four blank 
;spaces). If yes, all strings that follow this string of 
;four blank spaces should be reversed until 
;the next string of four blank spaces is encountered.
;For e.g. if the set of strings are
;'math’, 'have’, ' ', 'bury’, 'mine’, 'dine’, ' ' , 'hell’, 'deep’, 'tree’
;The ALP should change it to
;'math’, 'have’, ' ', 'yrub’, 'enim’, 'enid’ , ' ' , 'hell’, 'deep’, 'tree’
;You have to use a single instruction to reverse the string
