A set of marks of 30 students is stored from 
location labelled stmk. They are stored in 
ascending order. You will start moving data from 
the highest mark to amk. If the difference between 
two adjacent marks is more than 3 you will move 
it into the next array bmk. You will repeat 
this for cmk, dmk, emk. If anyone has less than 
5% marks move then to ncmk.

 The maximum marks possible is 100

 In the example shown below

At stmk the data is : 
97,96,95,94,90,89,88,86,85,84,83,80,78,
 76,75,73,71,70,65,63,61,59, 43,42, 41,  
 34,32,30,  4,1

After the program is executed

amk will have : 97,96,95,94

bmk will have: 
90,89,88,86,85,84,83,80,78, 76,75,73,71,70

cmk wil have: 65,63,61,59

dmk will have: 43,42,41

emk will have: 34,32,30

ncmk will have : 4, 1
